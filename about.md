About us
=======

We do marketing. You pick coconuts.
-----------

We are a Social Media agency from Krakow. We are excited about marketing, especially social media.

We create effective marketing campaigns based on the needs of customers. In our work, we focus on dynamics - we are never passive, we observe all activities on a regular basis, we experiment, optimize and draw conclusions. A whole team of specialists watches over each campaign. Thanks to this, we achieve the best results. 

Social media has no secrets for us.
-----------

We are a team of specialists, but we act and absorb knowledge as if we had just learned about the existence of the Internet. We focus on skills and creativity. Each of us has a complementary set of strengths, but we are united by one mission and common values.

We are not afraid of demanding projects. All we need is coffee and coconut milk.
