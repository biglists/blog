* A customer receipt from Nusr-Et Steakhouse in London has gone viral on Twitter
* Users have admitted they are shocked by the cost of dishes and service charge
* Receipt shows a can of Red Bull costs £11, while main dishes cost up to £700

A customer's receipt from Nusr-Et Steakhouse has gone viral on social media after totalling a staggering £1,812.40 - with a single steak priced at £630 and just four Red Bulls costing £44.

The eye-watering bill from 'Salt Bae's' newly opened restaurant in London's Knightsbridge also shows the table of eight customers had a £236.40 service charge added to their spend. 

Elsewhere, the customers paid £9 per glass of coke, £12 on four pieces of sweetcorn and £200 on a rack of lamb.

People have taken to Twitter to admit the prices on the viral receipt have discouraged them from visiting the restaurant, despite the opening having been highly anticipated since Nusret Gokce, also known as Salt Bae, went viral in 2017.

One person wrote: 'What the f*** is a golden burger? £100 is it the best burger in the world? And £630 for a steak? Lol I would have refused to pay and walked out... That's absolutely ridiculous £44 for Red Bull is also a nonsense' 

Another said: 'I hope the rest of the cow was given to you in a goody bag! £630 for a steak' 

A third added: '£9 for a coke. Bet the glass was short and thin and filled with ice to the brim. Lol'  'Why is baklava £22 lmao! I need to see that portion phew,' another wrote.
