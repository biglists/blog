Check!

Is it worth organizing social media contests?
-----------

Here are the benefits your brand will benefit from. First of all, it is worth starting with what benefits can be brought to your brand by organizing a competition on social media. They are mainly:

* greater scope of content - competitions are liked, shared and commented on, thanks to which they reach a wide audience;
* promoting a specific product - if you are introducing a novelty to the market or you want to make public about a product already in the offer, it is a good idea to organize a competition in which it will be a prize or its purchase will be one of the conditions for participation (more on this in moment);
* increasing engagement - in social media, contests are the type of content that generates the most audience responses, so you can organize them to stimulate your fans to be more active;
* increasing the motivation of fans to carefully observe the website - if your contests on Facebook or Instagram will appear regularly, the recipients will be more motivated to interact with the website more often and be up to date with its publications;
* obtaining UGC, i.e. User Generated Content - in contests, you can ask to take and publish photos that can later be used by the brand, e.g. in the form of a repost on Instagram.
It is also a chance to make the product available for testing to those who may not know it yet - if they like it, they can buy another one on their own.

Organizing a competition in social media - start by defining the purpose of your brand
-----------

Brands organize contests on social media to gain benefits for themselves. Think about what is most important for you: reach, engaging fans, showing the brand on the good side, promoting the selected product, or maybe increasing the number of fans, getting leads, gathering a list of people willing to use the service or sales?

Each of the above-mentioned goals is good and you can achieve each of them by organizing a competition on Facebook or Instagram.

Once you've chosen your goal, arrange the task so that completing it equates to achieving your goals. Often you will also complete side objectives, but make sure that the main one is the most important and that the mechanics of the game are prepared for it.

Competition in social media - how to come up with and choose a competition task?
-----------

Now that you know your goal, it's time to come up with a task to help you achieve it. Social media contests can be divided into two main types:

* competition with a low entry threshold,
* competition with a high entry threshold.

A competition with a low entry threshold is one in which you require little involvement from the user - e.g. to complete a sentence or answer a simple competition question. It is characterized by a large number of comments and shares, because participation in it takes up to a few minutes.

A competition with a high entry threshold requires greater involvement of the participant - they must spend more time participating in it, e.g. buy a product or take a photo in certain circumstances. In this type of competition, there are usually fewer entries, especially if the prize is not attractive enough.

The principle of creating a task is simple: the higher the entry threshold, the more valuable the reward should be and the lower the commitment can be. If you want to reward users with a package of ordinary company gadgets in exchange for doing art work, you can expect failure. The prize must be attractive enough to pay for commitment and play for it (especially as the win is not guaranteed).

Good and bad ideas for a task in a competition in social media
-----------

Here are some examples of task ideas:

* coming up with a creative advertising slogan for a product or company,
* creating an original meme,
* providing a creative answer to the question,
* telling a story related to the brand or its product,
* creative completion of the sentence, e.g. If I did not have to work, then ...

The word creative appears in tasks for a reason - it is often the criterion by which the participants' responses are assessed and the winners of social media competitions are selected on its basis. It is such a fluid and capacious concept that it almost eliminates it

Rules of the competition on Facebook or Instagram - what should you remember?

A competition organized in social media should primarily comply with Facebook's regulations. This means that it cannot be a lottery or a hand, and it cannot force the user to use their timeline or tag friends. Participants must be advised that the contest is not organized, endorsed, sponsored or otherwise related to Facebook. It must also comply with the laws in force in a given country.

A competition in social media should have its own rules, which include the following data:

* information about the organizer and founder of the awards,
* start and end date of the competition,
* rules for taking part in the competition,
* information about the prizes (their type, number and method of delivery),
* criteria for selecting the winner,
* complaint rules,
* privacy policy.

It is worth commissioning a lawyer to prepare the rules of the competition in social media. You can do it once and use the template developed by him for a long time, updated of course with the rules of a specific competition.

Where to publish the rules of the competition on Facebook or Instagram?
-----------

The regulations can be published on the brand's website in the form of a download file - however, this is not a very popular solution, mainly due to the fact that people handling social media often do not have administrative access to the website. Instead, you can throw the file as a PDF file (or .doc document) to your Google drive and make it read-only for users.

The link to the regulations must be included in the competition post on Facebook, and in the case of the competition on Instagram, link it in the bio or otherwise clearly explain to users how to find it.

How to promote the contest on social media?
-----------

You already know the goals for organizing contests in social media, you know how to formulate a task and what to include in the regulations. It's time to talk about distribution, another important factor that has a significant impact on results. How to promote the contest on Facebook or Instagram so that it reaches as many potential participants as possible?

1 Promotion of the competition using advertising on Facebook and Instagram
Promotion of a contest post is the simplest form of reaching the target group of your choice with your message. Thanks to it, you will direct the message primarily to people who may be interested in your brand and its products, so it is worth using this option.

What budget should be allocated to the promotion of the competition? It all depends on how difficult the task is - the higher the entry threshold, the more difficult it will be for Facebook to gain user activity, which will translate directly into cost-per-result.

2 Information in own brand media
Inform about the competition in all your own media, e.g. on your blog, newsletter, website or social media other than the one in which it is organized. In communication, emphasize the benefits of the participants and show the prizes, and the recipients of the content will not remain indifferent.

If you have a brick-and-mortar store or are a restaurant, prepare posters or leaflets informing you that the competition is ongoing and where to find it. You can put a QR code on them, which, after scanning with a smartphone, will take the interested person directly to the page with the competition.

3 Groups and pages devoted to contests
On Facebook you will find at least a dozen groups where you can share information about your competition. There are also special pages dedicated solely to distributing contests and connecting participants and organizers.

It sounds great, but remember that they are used mainly by people who take part in several dozen contests a month, the so-called contestants. It is almost certain that they will not become your customers later, because you are one of the many options for them to get giveaways. Their activity will, of course, help you increase your reach and commitment, but the winners are best chosen from those who have previously participated in the website or do not take part in all possible games of this type.

4 Cooperation with an influencer
Do you want the competition to have really large ranges and bring you even more benefits? Organize it in cooperation with an influencer who will help you prepare a game involving his community in activities related to your brand.

You can conduct the competition both on your own social media and those belonging to the influencer. In the case of such cooperation, it is worth taking care of really attractive and valuable prizes that will even more motivate participants to take part in the game.

Of course, you will need two documents prepared by a lawyer: the rules of the competition in social media and a cooperation agreement with an influencer specifying your mutual obligations.

5 Legible, clear information on the graphics in the competition post
The preparation of appropriate graphics will also help to increase the interest in the competition. In addition to an interesting photo or illustration in the background, include a clearly visible and legible word Competition on it. You can also mention or show the awards. The point is that the user who finds the competition photo during scrolling, immediately knows what it is about and devotes a longer time to this content - and maybe even immediately took part in the game.

How to choose prizes for a competition in social media and how to distribute them to participants?
The selection of awards in the competition is also an important element of its organization. As we wrote earlier, the higher the value of the prize, the more difficult the competition task can be - although of course it is worth remembering that the result may be fewer submissions (but they will be of higher quality).

The prize in the competition may be:

* your brand product (new or existing),
* a voucher to be used in your store or other stores that allow shopping with gift vouchers,
* access to a course, training or other digital content,
* a set of company accessories (but not lanyards and pens, such as branded thermal mugs or reusable containers),
* ticket or invitation to the event,
* a voucher to be used in a restaurant, workshops or consultations.

Competition in social media and tax
-----------

The value of the prizes is very important - above a certain amount (about PLN 2,000 in the case of natural persons not conducting business activity and entrepreneurs running agricultural activity), it will be necessary to pay 10% of the tax. This obligation rests with the winner of the competition, but you can show chivalry and take it upon yourself so as not to spoil the laureate's joy of winning. And of course, improve your image in his eyes;).

You can send the prizes by e-mail or by post - in the latter case, be sure to inform the users in the regulations that they will have to provide you with their address to collect the prize.

In the case of physical prizes, make sure that unpacking the package is a pleasure - let it be worth showing on social media. It is also an important part of the entire experience of a potential customer, thanks to which he will surely remember you for longer.

What about the people who didn't win the prize?
-----------

People who did not win the competition do not have to leave with anything - you can contact them and give them a special discount code for purchases in your store. It will be valuable especially for people who wanted to buy the product anyway or when promotions are really rare for you.

It is also a great way to show that you appreciate commitment and time.

Organization of the competition in social media - summary
-----------

The competition in social media is an opportunity to promote your brand at a relatively low cost. Thanks to it, you can reach people who can become potential clients of the company, and at the same time show that you appreciate being with you on social media. Before you organize it, think about your goal. Set a competition task in front of the participants that will make it easier for you to achieve it and make sure that everything is done within the law.
