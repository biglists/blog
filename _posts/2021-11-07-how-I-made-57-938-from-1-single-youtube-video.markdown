What's up, guys. I've been doing this for a long time, and finally decided to make a post for the newbies out there who want to learn more and get a better life.

But first, I'll stop talking for a second. Here's screenshot proof:
-----------


That's just from one video, by the way. One source of revenue, over $57k.

Now, let's talk about how I did it... but first, we need to dispel some common myths.


3 Biggest LIES About Making Money With YouTube
-----------

There's a ton of myths about making money on YouTube that I want to dispel, mainly because I bought into them when I first got started. Unfortunately, most of these myths will destroy any newbie's chances at success with YouTube, so please pay close attention.

Myth #1 - Ads Make You Money
-----------

Most people think the best way to make money from YouTube is by running ads, but at BEST ads will make you around $7 per 1,000 views.

There's been a lot of talk about doing YouTube re-upload methods lately, especially with Avengers fight scenes, car crash compilations, etc.

There's a few problems with these threads, but the biggest one is that they're making pennies and acting like it's a big deal. $10/day is nothing. My one video makes $300-500/day.

The second problem with this method, is that of all the ways to monetize a YouTube video, ads are the WORST. Don't get me wrong, you should still do them, but they pay almost nothing.

On average, YouTube content creators make $5 per 1,000 views. I didn't even monetize my video for the longest time, because it would've only made me like $3/day or something.

The best way to make money on YouTube is through AFFILIATE ADVERTISING.

I'll talk more about this later, but for now understand that even with viral fight scene videos, affiliate advertising will make you more money than ads.

AND that's assuming that you can even re-upload Avengers' End Game fight scenes or whatever without getting a copyright strike.

Myth #2 - Re-Upload Method Works
-----------

I'm probably going to get a lot of shit for saying this, but the re-upload method is garbage most of the time. Yes, there are rare occasions where for whatever reason, you just hit the right niche at the right time, and you make a lot of money. These occasions are far and few between, however.

In any marketplace, there is a barrier to entry. This is basically how hard it is to get into the marketplace and start making money.

The lower the barrier to entry, and the easier it is to get into the marketplace, the more competition you're going to have. So, with this in mind, let's talk about the re-upload method again.

How hard is it to rip some DVD's and re-upload them onto YouTube? How hard is it to find some car crash compilation video, increase the speed by 5%, add some music, and a watermark so it doesn't get flagged for copyright infringement?

IT'S FUCKING EASY.

So your competition is going to be doing this, and it's virtually impossible to get a foothold unless you've got an established channel that's been doing it for half a decade.

The method I used was NOT re-uploading a video. It was 100% unique. I'll explain more about this in a second, but first understand this, because it's REALLY important.

People have a tendency to think that you can "trick" YouTube or Google, which is 100% bullshit. I'm not saying that PBN's don't work, because they do. BUT, there's no "one magic pill" or "one quick fix" that's going to blast your rankings to #1.

It's going to take consistent effort, consistent link-building, and constant work. This is a good thing however, because 99% of people aren't willing to do this, so if you are, you're only competing with 1%.

Myth #3 - YouTube is Hard to Rank
-----------


Now, here's another big myth. One reason people stay away from YouTube is because they think it's hard to get views and/or rank. This is only true if you don't know what you're doing.

90% of ranking on YT comes down to three things:
KILLER Thumbnail
Great Title & Tags
Engaging Content
That's it. If you can master these three things, YouTube will basically give you free traffic. My video has been getting 1,000+ views/day for months now, and while this might not be the "viral video" that people want, it's better to have steady income than a spurt of $3k here and there.


How I Did It (3 Steps)
-----------

Alright, now onto the good part. Let's talk about the 3-step process I used to create this video, and start making money while I sleep.

Here they are:
Find A Profitable, Low Competition Niche
Find A Good Affiliate Program
Record, Edit, & Upload The Video
That's it. It's not that hard once you get the hang of it, and you can easily keep doing the same thing over and over once you figure out how to do it.

With that in mind, let's talk a little bit more in-depth about how to do this, though.

Step #1 - Find A Profitable, Low Competition Niche
-----------

The problem I see most newbies having is they go after niches that are WAY too big. This has been said 10,000 times on BHW already, so I won't harp on this too much.

A great tool you can use is Ahrefs though, to see how many people are searching for specific keywords. Keep in mind that Google is now showing videos in their SERP's as well, so if you perform well on YouTube, they may rank you for the Google search results, too.

Here's a quick snapshot of their tool, which you can use to find keywords:

While 1,000 may not seem like a lot, in reality, it's going to be a LOT MORE than this. The first reason why is that this doesn't include long tail keywords.

It shows that 1,000 people are searching for "best gaming desks" each month, but that's not including 600 people searching "best desks for gaming setups" or other people searching for specific gaming desk reviews, which your video can rank for.

Long story short, find a keyword that's getting less than 5,000 searches/month for that specific keyword on YouTube, and then go from there.
